# Urban Air Pollution Prediction

## Authors
- Hongdu WEI
- Michael KAHLA

## Overview
This project aims to predict urban air pollution levels using various machine learning models, including Random Forest and XGBoost. For the selftest part, it is complete work of Hongdu WEI and it is the answer to all the R coding questions posted on UV.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from the [Zindi Urban Air Pollution Challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/zindiweekendz-learning-urban-air-pollution-challenge).

## Files in the Repository
- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis for the project.
- `data.zip`: Compressed file containing the dataset.
- `dataset.txt`: Information about the dataset and its source.
- `SampleSubmission_randomforest.csv`: Sample submission file using the Random Forest model.
- `SampleSubmission_xgBoost.csv`: Sample submission file using the XGBoost model.

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook (Jupyter able to run R code)
