# Urban Air Pollution Prediction

## Authors
- Hongdu WEI
- Michael KAHLA

## Overview
This project aims to predict urban air pollution levels using various machine learning models, including Random Forest and XGBoost.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from the [Zindi Urban Air Pollution Challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/zindiweekendz-learning-urban-air-pollution-challenge).

## Files in the Repository
- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis for the project.
- `data.zip`: Compressed file containing the dataset.
- `dataset.txt`: Information about the dataset and its source.
- `SampleSubmission_randomforest.csv`: Sample submission file using the Random Forest model.
- `SampleSubmission_xgBoost.csv`: Sample submission file using the XGBoost model.

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook (Jupyter able to run R code)

## Model Training and Evaluation
The project includes training and evaluation of different machine learning models. Key steps include:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling.
2. **Model Training:** Training Random Forest and XGBoost models on the dataset.
3. **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².

## Results
- The `SampleSubmission_randomforest.csv` and `SampleSubmission_xgBoost.csv` files contain the prediction results of the respective models.
- Detailed analysis and results are available in the `main.ipynb` notebook.
